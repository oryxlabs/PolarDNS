This module implements **alias loops** using **MX (Mail Exchange)** records. The loops can be a **direct loop**, where the alias points back to the **same domain name** as in the original query, or they can include **multiple elements**, cycling through a specified number of domains.

The idea is that if the client/resolver decides to resolve this further, it will enter an **infinite loop**. In practice, however, most modern resolvers detect such loops and terminate the resolution.

Note that this feature provides the same functionality as requesting a MX record for the generic [loop] feature.

:warning:**BEWARE**:warning:This can potentially lead to a domain lock-up (DoS).

Where:

- The **`<NUMBER>`** parameter specifies the number of elements the loop should contain.
