The DNS protocol supports compressing domain names to save space by reducing redundancy for repeated domain names within DNS messages. This compression scheme can be applied to various record (resource) types, such as **A**, **CNAME**, **MX**, or **PTR** records.

DNS compression works by using pointers to refer back to previously specified domain names within the DNS message. Here are the key aspects of the compression scheme:

- **Pointers**: The compression scheme uses **2-byte pointers** that refer to previous occurrences of the same domain name (or a part of the domain name) within the DNS message.
- **Format**: The pointer mechanism is encoded with the first two bits set to 11, followed by a **14-bit offset** indicating the location of the domain name in the message.
- **Offset**: The offset specifies the location of the domain name relative to the beginning of the DNS packet, allowing the pointer to reference where the domain name can be found.

This particular module is designed to respond with a single answer containing a compressed **CNAME record** (alias) pointing to the `abc.badcompress2.yourdomain.com` domain. This domain is constructed as follows:

- `abc.` + compression pointer to the original domain name in the QUERY section (`badcompress2.yourdomain.com`).

Typically, the compression pointer points to the **offset 12**, where the original domain name is located in the **QUERY section**. This is a common and fixed location in many standard DNS responses, represented by the typical **0xc00c** byte value used instead of the domain name.

However, this module allows the compression pointer to point to **any location** within the DNS message by specifying an **arbitrary offset**.

By specifying various offsets, this will inevitably lead to parsing errors.

format = '''
**`badcompress2.<OFFSET>.yourdomain.com`**

Where:

- The **`<OFFSET>`** parameter specifies the offset location relative to the beginning of the DNS packet.

Note that an offset of 12 is the typical location where the original domain name is located in the QUERY section.
